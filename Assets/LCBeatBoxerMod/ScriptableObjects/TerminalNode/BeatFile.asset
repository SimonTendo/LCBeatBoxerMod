    turns my stomach inside out


    Scientific name: TBD


    Suspected as the
    one who orchestated the events that occured at Sirus Ukwezi, the gorilla with
    stage name "The Beat" has always been known for its higher-than-usual intelligence.
    Having been taught to read musical scores and play for shows is its most popular
    display of intelligence among the general public, but even long before its inclusion
    in the circus'' program, locals living near the tribe it was born in have said
    that it made for a natural leader, displaying calmness in a way that prevented
    conflict with other animals through what appears to be mediation.


    However,
    having been taken out of its natural habitat to put on performances purely for
    its unique physical traits seems to have changed this demeanor, as circus personnel
    have described it as distant and deceitful, playing tricks on them, as well as
    stealing caretakers'' tools, some of the circus owner''s antique paraphernalia,
    and the circus'' transportation devices used to travel between planets. Its these
    traits that have spread the popular rumor that it deviced the escape in the middle
    of the show, together with fellow performer "The Boxer".


    Ever since, it
    has been spotted a handful of times, having stowed away in abandoned buildings
    on planets now void of civilization, in what behavioral experts assume to be
    an attempt to escape human presence. Few witness accounts exist however, stating
    that it first charged at whoever was looking at it, before it set up an ambush
    of sorts, using the stolen antiques from the circus to trick the listener into
    thinking it is elsewhere than it really is. Subsequently, it appears to become
    enraged when this ambush is unsuccessful, or when provoked. But despite its naturally
    far superior strength compared to humans, it lacks the combat skills to properly
    go on the offense.


    Survivors therefore advice, should you run into it yourself,
    to avoid the general area you hear its iconic footsteps from, to avoid both its
    charge and its ambush. And they recall that, when attacking, it clumsily tries
    to set its target up straight so it can swing at the head. Their advice has thus
    been to stay calm and react fast by quickly making yourself small or staying
    light enough to keep running away, until you either make enough distance or it
    tries to go into its next ambush.
