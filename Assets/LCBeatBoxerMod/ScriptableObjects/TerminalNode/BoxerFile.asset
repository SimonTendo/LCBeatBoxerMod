    Sigurd''s danger level: -100% this guy is so chill


    Scientific
    name: TBD


    As if living up to its stage name, the gorilla known as "The
    Boxer" has been recorded to have caused the most damage during the bloodbath
    that occured during their escape from Sirus Ukwezi. Surprisingly, however, it
    has displayed the friendliest bonds with the personnel out of all the trained
    animals that were kept at the circus, forming a particularly strong bond with
    its personal trainer, former minor circuit contender Frederick Raymond, and always
    sticking close to fellow performer "The Beat", presumably because it had a hard
    time adjusting to the circus environment.


    It even helped stage hands with
    carrying around heavy equipment, which it can do without needing to sacrifice
    its top speed, naturally thanks to its above-average strength and unique physical
    characteristics, for which it was accrued into the show as a cage-fight-inspired
    act to begin with. It adjusting so well to this new environment can be described
    as nothing short of a miracle, as its temper in the wilderness was described
    by locals as competitive, constantly seeking out fights with opponents stronger
    than itself, or weaker opponents whom it tried giving a level playing field.


    Countless
    animal rights activists that have stood up against Sirus Ukwezi have sought it
    out ever since their escape from the show, particularly by traveling to thinly
    forested planets where the particular types of Musa acuminata x balbisiana grow
    low enough for both of them to reach the fruits. Encounters with the gorilla
    were predominantly described as positive, stating it to be gentle and nurturing
    to the small, weak, and lonely. Although this comes as no surprise to some experts,
    who are eager to point out the misconception in the media of gorillas being presented
    as naturally violent creatures.


    However, a small handful of encounters
    do state violently competitive tendencies, with an emerging pattern of these
    accounts recalling to have approached too quickly while it was observing, having
    carried heavy or defensive equipment, or by having stuck to large groups. These
    witnesses have also stated, however, that their knowledge of the circus show
    has helped them avoid its attacks, as it seems to follow the exact same predictable
    pattern it used to in its performance, using the sound of the antique boxing-ring
    bell to signify the start of the show they were now in the middle of.
